# MASPY_BDI - Multi-Agent System for Python

Doing:
  - Implementing small upgrades
  
Todo:
  - Implement Descriptive Componet to Methods
  - Make better error managment
  - Look into a more robust reasoning cycle
  - Warning System and depuration of Code
  - Introduce threading and parallelism
  - Introduce Machine Learning in Agent Reasoning

Done:
  - All types of messages acts implemented
  - Plan decorator for simpler e explicit programming
  - Connections and Utilizations of Env and Channels Remade
  - Version 1.0 of the Reasoning Cycle
  - Beliefs, Objectives and Plans Managment Made Simpler
  - Implemented agent's percepetion can detect environment's facts
  - Agents can "connect" to environment by importing it
  - Environment's facts managment 
  - Coordinator can start and stop reasoning cycle of agents
  - Coordinator class for distinct agent names
  - Added possibility of multiple comunication channels
  - Comunication between Agent using a function wrapper
  - Agent's Beliefs, Objectives and Plans managment
